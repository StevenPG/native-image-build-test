# Explanation

The goal here isn't the first execution, nor is it for the most optimized run. Just a couple reruns and the average/best value.
These systems have real performance differences, so we're just looking for a ballpark difference between them.

NOTE: Rerun the first gradle run, since it'll probably download gradle as part of the run! And pulling dependencies! We only care about CPU, no download variances!

This project can be run by setting your java home to a GraalVM JDK.

`./gradlew clean nativeRun` is all that's needed to perform the graalvm test.
Look for the following sections in the output:

`Finished generating 'demo' in 1m 19s.` and `Started DemoApplication in 0.207 seconds`

JDK tests can be run using `./gradlew clean compileJava` and `./gradlew clean bootRun`

The compileJava is the total time and the bootRun is the startup time, e.g:

`BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 654ms` and for bootRun, `Started DemoApplication in 1.387 seconds`
